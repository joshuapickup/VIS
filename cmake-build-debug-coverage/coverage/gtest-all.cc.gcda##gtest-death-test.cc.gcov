        -:  651:// the specifics of pipes on Windows, some extra steps are required:
        -:  652://
        -:  653:// 1. The parent creates a communication pipe and stores handles to both
        -:  654://    ends of it.
        -:  655:// 2. The parent starts the child and provides it with the information
        -:  656://    necessary to acquire the handle to the write end of the pipe.
        -:  657:// 3. The child acquires the write end of the pipe and signals the parent
        -:  658://    using a Windows event.
        -:  659:// 4. Now the parent can release the write end of the pipe on its side. If
        -:  660://    this is done before step 3, the object's reference count goes down to
        -:  661://    0 and it is destroyed, preventing the child from acquiring it. The
        -:  662://    parent now has to release it, or read operations on the read end of
        -:  663://    the pipe will not return when the child terminates.
        -:  664:// 5. The parent reads child's output through the pipe (outcome code and
        -:  665://    any possible error messages) from the pipe, and its stderr and then
        -:  666://    determines whether to fail the test.
