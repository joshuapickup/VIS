# Python-Like Interpreter in C++

## Overview
This project is my final-year university project â€” a custom Python-like interpreter built entirely in C++.  
It supports arithmetic, variables, booleans, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic output, all in a simple interpreted language.

The goal of the project is to:
- Learn about language parsing, tokenization, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) execution.
- Implement a minimal but expressive scripting language inspired by Python's syntax.
- Provide a sandboxed environment for evaluating expressions and running scripts.

## Features
- **Arithmetic**: Integers, decimals, operator precedence, parentheses.
- **Variables**: Declaration, assignment, increment/decrement, usage in expressions.
- **Booleans & Logic**: `true`, `false`, `and`, `or`, `not`.
- **Comparisons**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`.
- **Control Flow**: `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`.
- **Functions**: Definition, parameters, return values, calling.
- **Basic Output**: `out("...")` to print to console.
- **Nested Expressions**: Arithmetic or boolean expressions inside control flow and function calls.

## Example Commands

Below is the full list of supported syntax examples.  
`~` means the text after it is a comment (ignored by the interpreter).
